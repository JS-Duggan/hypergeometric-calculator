# Hypergeometric calculator

### Symbols
- N: Total population size
- S: Number of succeses in the population
- n: Number of draws(sample size)
- k: Number of successes you want in your sample
- $\binom{a}{b} $: the number of ways to choose b items from a set of a, without regard to order
- $P(X = k)$: the probability of k succeses

### Formula


$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{S}{k} \, \binom{N - S}{n - k}}{\binom{N}{n}}
$$
